# studentGradeTracker
In this program Student has to give obtained marks and total marks of each subject and then click on calculate.

The result i.e., Total marks obtained, Percentage, Grade Obtained, GPA, And a message will be shown.

**Project Overview:**
The Student Grade Tracker is a Java-based application designed to help students and educators track and calculate grades for multiple subjects. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using `JFrame` and related Swing components, making it easy to input marks and display results visually.

**Features:**
1. **User Input:**
   - The application prompts the user to enter the number of subjects.
   - For each subject, the user can input the marks obtained and the maximum possible marks using text fields.
  
2. **Calculation:**
   - The application calculates the total marks obtained across all subjects, the total possible marks, and the average percentage.
   - Based on the average percentage, the application assigns a Grade Point Average (GPA) and a letter grade (A to F).
   - The application also provides personalized feedback based on the obtained grade.

3. **Graphical User Interface:**
   - The GUI is structured using `GridBagLayout`, providing a flexible and organized layout.
   - It includes labels and text fields for marks entry, a "Calculate" button to process the data, and a large text area to display the results.
   - The results section shows a detailed summary, including the total marks obtained, percentage, grade, GPA, and a congratulatory message.

4. **Result Display:**
   - The result area is prominently displayed and formatted to be easily readable.
   - The results include:
     - Total Marks Obtained and Total Maximum Marks.
     - Percentage of marks.
     - Grade obtained and corresponding GPA.
     - Personalized feedback message based on the grade.

**Educational Value:**
- **Learning Objective:** This project is an excellent exercise in object-oriented programming, GUI design, and event-driven programming using Java Swing.
- **Practical Use:** The application can be used by students for self-assessment or by educators as a simple tool for quick grade calculation.

**Conclusion:**
The Student Grade Tracker project provides a practical and interactive way to manage and calculate student grades. With its user-friendly GUI, it serves as a useful educational tool and a solid example of applying Java programming skills to real-world scenarios.
